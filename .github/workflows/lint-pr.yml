            We require pull request titles to follow the convention bellow, which is a slight variation of https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/ in which we add the ticket number after the PR type:

            ```
            Available types:
              - feat: Ticket-<ticketNumber> A new feature
              - fix: Ticket-<ticketNumber> A bug fix
              - docs: Ticket-<ticketNumber> Documentation only changes
              - style: Ticket-<ticketNumber> Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
              - refactor: Ticket-<ticketNumber> A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
              - perf: Ticket-<ticketNumber> A code change that improves performance
              - test: Ticket-<ticketNumber> Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
              - build: Ticket-<ticketNumber> Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
              - ci: Ticket-<ticketNumber> Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
              - chore: Ticket-<ticketNumber> Other changes that don't modify src or test files
              - revert: Ticket-<ticketNumber> Reverts a previous commit
            ```
